# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

### Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically categorize movie reviews into two sentiment categories: positive and negative. This tool will enable the analysis of public opinion in real-time, helping to assess how audiences respond to movies.
This project leverages various machine learning algorithms to classify sentiment, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, and provides a user-friendly interface through a Streamlit web app.

### Features
- Movie Review Sentiment Classification: Automatically categorize movie reviews into positive or negative sentiment using NLP techniques.
- Machine Learning Models: Implements Logistic Regression and Random Forest models for classification.
- Real-time Analysis: The Streamlit app allows users to input movie reviews and get instant sentiment classification results.
- Customizable UI: The app includes a personalized Streamlit theme for better user experience.
